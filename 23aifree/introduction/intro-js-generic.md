# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Oracle's Multilingual Engine (MLE), powered by GraalVM, offers a highly performant and enhanced JavaScript engine in Oracle Database 23ai on Linux x86-64.

In addition to PL/SQL and Java it is now possible to leverage the Smart DB paradigm with an additional language, JavaScript, opening the database to a huge community of developers. Processing data where they live should offer advantages in performance, scalability, and security. It also allows for a loose coupling between frontend and database, an essential feature for modern application development.

This workshop introduces JavaScript in Oracle Database 23ai on Linux x86-64 and walks you through all the steps necessary to be productive with the new language. It complements [Oracle Database JavaScript Developer's Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/mlejs/index.html). This Live Lab is geared towards Autonomous Database, therefore you will use Database Actions as your primary way of interacting with both the database and In-Database JavaScript.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hours 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

- Get started with JavaScript development using a community module in your application
- Create JavaScript modules and environments
- Declare JavaScript functions
- Interact with the database using the JavaScript SQL Driver
- Work effectively with JSON
- Get insights into your code's behaviour using Post Execution Debugging

You may now proceed to the next lab.
